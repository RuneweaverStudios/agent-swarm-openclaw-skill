# Agent Swarm | OpenClaw Skill

## What this skill does

Agent Swarm is a traffic cop for AI models.
It picks the best model for each task, then starts a sub-agent to do the work.

### IMPORTANT: OpenRouter is required

**Required Platform Configuration:**
- **OpenRouter API key**: Must be configured in OpenClaw platform settings (not provided by this skill)
- **OPENCLAW_HOME** (optional): Environment variable pointing to OpenClaw workspace root. If not set, defaults to `~/.openclaw`
- **openclaw.json access**: The router reads `tools.exec.host` and `tools.exec.node` from `openclaw.json` (located at `$OPENCLAW_HOME/openclaw.json` or `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`). Only these two fields are accessed; no gateway secrets or API keys are read.

**Model Requirements:**
- Model IDs must use `openrouter/...` prefix
- If OpenRouter is not configured in OpenClaw, delegation will fail

## Why this helps

- Faster replies (cheap orchestrator, smart sub-agent routing)
- Better quality (code tasks go to code models, writing tasks go to writing models)
- Lower cost (you do not run every task on the most expensive model)

## Core rule (non-negotiable)

For user tasks, the orchestrator must delegate.
It must NOT answer the task itself.

Use this flow every time:

1. Run router:
   ```bash
   python3 workspace/skills/agent-swarm/scripts/router.py spawn --json "<user message>"
   ```
   
   **Note:** Use relative paths from your OpenClaw workspace root, or set `OPENCLAW_HOME` environment variable and use `$OPENCLAW_HOME/workspace/skills/agent-swarm/scripts/router.py`.
2. If `needs_config_patch` is true: stop and report that patch to the user.
3. Otherwise call:
   `sessions_spawn(task=..., model=..., sessionTarget=...)`
4. Wait for `sessions_spawn` result.
5. Return the sub-agent result to the user.

If `sessions_spawn` fails, return only a delegation failure message.
Do not do the task yourself.

## Quick examples

### Single task

Router output:
`{"task":"write a poem","model":"openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5","sessionTarget":"isolated"}`

Then call:
`sessions_spawn(task="write a poem", model="openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", sessionTarget="isolated")`

### Parallel tasks

```bash
python3 workspace/skills/agent-swarm/scripts/router.py spawn --json --multi "fix bug and write poem"
```

This returns multiple spawn configs. Start one sub-agent per config.

## Commands

```bash
python scripts/router.py default
python scripts/router.py classify "fix lint errors"
python scripts/router.py spawn --json "write a poem"
python scripts/router.py spawn --json --multi "fix bug and write poem"
python scripts/router.py models
```

## Config basics

Edit `config.json` to change routing:

- `default_model` = orchestrator default
- `routing_rules.<TIER>.primary` = main model for tier
- `routing_rules.<TIER>.fallback` = backups

## Security

### Input Validation

The router validates and sanitizes all inputs to prevent injection attacks:

- **Task strings**: Validated for length (max 10KB), null bytes, and suspicious patterns
- **Config patches**: Only allows modifications to `tools.exec.host` and `tools.exec.node` (whitelist approach)
- **Labels**: Validated for length and null bytes

### Safe Execution

**Critical**: When calling `router.py` from orchestrator code, always use `subprocess` with a list of arguments, **never** shell string interpolation:

```python
# ✅ SAFE: Use subprocess with list arguments
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(
    ["python3", "/path/to/router.py", "spawn", "--json", user_message],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True
)

# ❌ UNSAFE: Shell string interpolation (vulnerable to injection)
import os
os.system(f'python3 router.py spawn --json "{user_message}"')  # DON'T DO THIS
```

The router uses Python's `argparse`, which safely handles arguments when passed as a list. Shell string interpolation is vulnerable to command injection if the user message contains shell metacharacters.

### Config Patch Safety

The `recommended_config_patch` only modifies safe fields:
- `tools.exec.host` (must be 'sandbox' or 'node')
- `tools.exec.node` (only when host is 'node')

All config patches are validated before being returned. The orchestrator should validate patches again before applying them to `openclaw.json`.

### Prompt Injection Mitigation

Task strings are passed to `sessions_spawn` and then to sub-agents. While the router validates input format, prompt injection protection is primarily the responsibility of:
1. The orchestrator (validating task strings)
2. The sub-agent LLM (resisting prompt injection)
3. The OpenClaw platform (sanitizing `sessions_spawn` inputs)

### File Access

**Required File Access:**
- **Read**: `openclaw.json` (located via `OPENCLAW_HOME` environment variable or `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`)
  - **Fields accessed**: `tools.exec.host` and `tools.exec.node` only
  - **Purpose**: Determine execution environment for spawned sub-agents
  - **Security**: The router does NOT read gateway secrets, API keys, or any other sensitive configuration

**Write Access:**
- **Write**: None (no files are written by this skill)
- **Config patches**: The skill may return `recommended_config_patch` JSON that the orchestrator can apply, but the skill itself does not write to `openclaw.json`

**Security Guarantees:**
- The router does not persist, upload, or transmit any tokens or credentials
- Only `tools.exec.host` and `tools.exec.node` are accessed from `openclaw.json`
- All file access is read-only except for validated config patches (whitelisted to `tools.exec.*` only)

### Other Security Notes

- This skill does not expose gateway secrets.
- Use `gateway-guard` separately for gateway/auth management.
- The router does not execute arbitrary code or modify files outside of config patches.
- The phrase "saves tokens" in documentation refers to **cost savings** (using cheaper models for simple tasks), not token storage or collection.
